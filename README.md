  Roles are the permissions granted to Agents per Department that they have access to. Each Role has a set of permissions that can be checked/unchecked for agents given that Role in association with a Department they have access to. An unlimited number of roles can be created and assigned to Agents with access to various departments.

<p>
Since tickets are routed through Departments in the help desk, there are many settings that can be set for each Department.

<p>
Teams allow you to pull Agents from different Departments and organize them to handle a specific issue or user via a Help Topic or Ticket Filter.
Having Agents from different Departments assigned to a Team will supersede the parameters of the Agents’ Department rules. For example, you can create a Help Topic associated with a particular product you produce, and assign it to a Team of specialist Agents from different Departments.

</p>
<p>
Agents are given access to the help desk with the intent to respond and resolve the tickets. When adding an Agent to the help desk, they will need to be assigned to a Primary Department and given a Primary Role for the Tickets/Tasks routed to that department. Agents can be given Extended Access to additional departments of the help desk as well as assigned different Roles to those departments; this can be configured in the Access tab of the Agent’s Profile.

<p>
Users can now create an account and log-in to create a ticket or check a ticket’s status. As always with osTicket, users or ticket creators are associated with their email address as the unique identifier of each user. The User Directory, located on the Agent Panel, allows agents to search tickets by user as well as create Organizations to associate the user to. Agents can be configured as internal Account Managers for tickets created by users of an Organization.

</p>
<p>
SLA Plans or Service Level Agreements, are unlimited in osTicket. The purpose of the SLA Plan is to provide a length of time in which the help desk Administrator expects tickets to be closed.

Help Topics will help streamline your end-user’s help desk experience to ensure proper assignment and prompt response to the ticket. Create as many Help Topics as needed and can even nest Help Topics within each other for further breakdown (For example, Human Resources and Human Resources/Payroll.)
Help Topics will determine what Department the ticket is routed to which will determine which Agents have access to the ticket. The Help Topic also can determine other configurations of the ticket, such as the ticket’s SLA (or Service Level Agreement) and priority of a ticket, i.e. Emergency to Low.
